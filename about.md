Hi! My name is William Zheng and I'm from Long Island. I'm currently a sophomore studying Applied Math and Computer Science at Columbia University and also work as an undergraduate researcher in the Basov Infrared Lab. I enjoy running and being curious about random projects so this is my place to put share some of my random projects I embark on.

Complex mathematical machinery leveraged by powerful computers is what I think can solve any problem.
