# Regret-Based Exploration and Latent Space Clustering in SUNRISE Deep Q-Network Ensembles

For a class project, I recently implemented some naive techniques to improve ensembles for Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). The ensemble technique R-SUNRISE borrows on ideas from Decision Theoretical Online Learning (DTOL) algorithms that I've previously used for online ensembles for time series forecasting. The ensemble technique U-SUNRISE attempts to do simple representation learning through allowing specific DQNs to learn specific regions in a high dimensional space (like an image) through learning from specific clusters of images (obtained through PCA + k-means clustering). While it shows some mixed results, it was a fun experimentation for further applications of ensembles. I might need to lay off the ensembles for a bit.
